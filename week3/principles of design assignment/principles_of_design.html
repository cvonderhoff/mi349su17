  <h1>Principles of Design Assignment</h1>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Affordance</h2>
	<img src="tigerswebsite.jpg" alt="Detroit Tigers Website" style="width:800px;height:480px;"/>
	<p>The reason why I chose this website for the Tigers is because they hightlighted the Tickets button a different color because they wanted to make sure the viewer knew that it was a button. This is affordance because they creator of the site made sure everyone knew that it was a button to use.</p>
	<h2>Mapping</h2>
	<img src="msuwebsite.jpg" alt="MSU Website" style="width:800px;height:480px;"/>
	<p>The reason why I chose the MSU website for mapping is because the website does a great job of being organized and sticking with the layout. It is considered mapping because the site does a good job of following the layout. </p>
	<h2>Hick's Law</h2>
	<img src="netflixwebsite.jpg" alt="Netflix Website" style="width:800px;height:480px;"/>
	<p>The reason why I picked this site for Hick's Law is because netflix does a good job after logging in of limiting options which are pick a user or add a new one. This represents the law because it gives simple decision to the user.</p>
	<h2>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>
	<img src="googlewebsite.jpg" alt="Google Website" style="width:800px;height:480px;"/>
	<p>The reason why I picked the google sight for this principle is because this sight has little to no ads. That fits the Signal-to-Noise Ratio because it limits things that do not pertain to the functionality of the website.</p>
	<h2>Chunking</h2>
	<img src="nytimes.jpg" alt="New York Times Website" style="width:800px;height:480px;"/>
	<p>The reason why I picked this site for this principle is because this site does a good job of getting as much information in one place so there is options. This is chunking because all of the options are put in a similar area.</p>
